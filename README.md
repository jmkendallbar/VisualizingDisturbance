# Visualizing Fear in Three Dimensions

This repository hosts working code I am using to visualize disturbance in three dimensions with marine mammals through animation and interactive graphics. This involves a number of different projects:

1) Benthic foraging behavior of humpback whales and implications for bottom-set fishing gear
2) Visualizing behavioral and physiological responses of northern elephant seals to predator vocalizations of killer whales
3) Visualizing behavioral and physiological responses of narwhals to anthropogenic sonar
4) Lightscapes of fear: behavioral adaptation to changes in body condition
