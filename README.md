# Visualizing Fear in Three Dimensions

This repository hosts working code I am using to visualize disturbance in three dimensions with marine mammals through animation and interactive graphics. This involves a number of different projects:

1) Benthic foraging behavior of humpback whales and implications for bottom-set fishing gear
2) Visualizing behavioral and physiological responses of northern elephant seals to predator vocalizations of killer whales
      
      A) Linking instantaneous heart rate data to sound using psychopy (Auditory Neurophysiology python toolbox):
      HR_sound.py

      B) Linking 3D position data to movement of 3D model with Python for Autodesk Maya:
      Seal Sample Data Input Code.py
      references: Seal Sample Data CSV files
      
      C) Testing sound generation in Super Collider - was super cool but too fancy for what I needed.
      
4) Visualizing behavioral and physiological responses of narwhals to anthropogenic sonar
5) Lightscapes of fear: behavioral adaptation to changes in body condition
